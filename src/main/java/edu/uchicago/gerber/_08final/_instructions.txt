Create a classic video game using the tools you've learned throughout the quarter.
1/ You MUST extend the existing base-code architecture of which Asteroids is just
 one example implementation. You MUST use the Movable interface, Sprite, CommandCenter, GameOpsQueue, GameOp, GameFrame,
 GamePanel, Sound, and Game classes. You must use the existing collision detection. You must use a
 separate List of Movables for each Team, though you a free to add, remove, or rename your Teams. The expectation is
 that you will swap out the appropriate classes in the model directory for your models, and change the game logic in
 the Game and CommandCenter classes to suit your game. Failing to extend the base-code architecture will result in an
 automatic and non-negotiable zero on this evaluation.
2/ You can create any video game you want, EXCEPT Asteroids.
3/ You may code your game in either Java or Kotlin; see README.md of proJava for Kotlin instructions.


The reason I require students to extend the base-code architecture is to: (1) level the playing field,
(2) provide a foundation upon which students can build, and (3) provide implementations for
difficult challenges like I/O and collision detection which allows students to focus on their
game logic, and not the details of I/O, etc.

This game uses both vector and raster graphics.
The advantage of vector graphics is that they scale infinitely, and they render extremely fast. If you use
raster graphics (png's) which are essentially two-dimensional grids of pixels, make sure to reduce
 the pixel density, otherwise your game will lag when rendering. For
 raster graphics implementation, see the Falcon or WhiteCloudDebris classes.

Please heed the following:

1/ For collision detection, do NOT attempt to detect the intersection of two polygons
including rectangles. Use the existing circle-collision-detection algorithm. Your sprites should effectively be a shape
with equal width and height circumscribed/inscribed by a circle, as this
facilitates collision detection.  If you want to create non-square rectilinear shapes, walls, or other odd
 shapes, you can build them one brick at a time; see the Brick class.

2/ Start with the Asteroids game and make incremental changes to it. You will avoid a lot of problems taking
this approach. Your game should not stray too far from Asteroids initially. As you get more familiar with the game and
its architecture, you can take more risks, but always be prepared to roll back your changes. Git is your best friend
for experimenting with new features of your game.  Games like 1941, Joust, Galaga, Space Invaders, Missile Command, are
good inspiration. Take advantage of the existing architecture with its
free-form deltaX and deltaY; do not try to create a game that requires a grid like Tetris, Break-out, or Pong
as these are not well suited to this base-code architecture.

3/ Commit (with git) often as you develop your game. This will allow the TAs to see your development process. Don't be
afraid to fail. If you reach a dead-end, revert (git) to the last good commit and continue.

4/ If you find your gaming groove, then you can explode beyond the bounds of the existing Game.DIM and create an entire
world with a mini-map, and new levels, etc. See Sinistar in moregames (git@github.com:agerber/moregames.git) for how to
create a mini-map. Other big-world 2D games that cycle are Defender, Mario Bros, etc.

The TAs will select the top ten games. The ten finalists will demonstrate their games and present their code and
architecture, and the class will vote on the best game. The winner will receive a token prize during an
awards-ceremony on the last day.
