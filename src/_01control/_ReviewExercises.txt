R1.5 The following are all benefits to using Java over machine code:
1/ Java bytecode is platform independent and may be run on any system that has a JVM. This quality is known as portability.
2/ Java JIT compilers can run efficient Java programs as fast or faster than machine code programs
3/ Java is memory-managed. This reduces about 95% of runtime errors (mostly memory-related) as compared to unmanaged code.
4/ Java was designed for networking and the Internet in mind; and it is generally safer than machine code
