## All homework assignments base-code for Java Programming UChicago MPCS 51036

This project contains all the base code you will need for your homework (called projects) in Java Programming 51036 -- but not the answers :(
There are also some simple examples in this project. Each package (e.g. _01control) contains a file called _instructions.txt which contains instructions for each project.

## the master branch

The master branch is the branch that your graders will grade. No other branch will be graded.

## Access

You will fork this project and then push to it as you complete your assignments.
You may create however many branches you like, but be sure to merge those changes back to master as master is the only branch that the graders will evaluate.

If you don't know how to merge, stay on master...or ask me during office hours and I will show you how to merge.
